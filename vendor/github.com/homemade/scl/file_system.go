/*
A FileSystem is a representation of entities with names and content that can be
listed using stangard glob syntax and read by name. The typical implementation
for this is a local disk filesystem, but it could be anything â€“ records in a
database, objects on AWS S3, the contents of a zip file, virtual files stored
inside a binary, and so forth. A FileSystem is required to instantiate the
standard Parser implementation.
